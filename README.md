ChordFork
========

ChordFork is a simple song hosting/dvcs application which I have begun working 
on for the class CS184. Users will have the ability to upload songs, where a 
song is currently a simple chord progression, rework those songs over time while 
saving different revisions, fork other users' public songs, and share songs with 
other users or friends. 

In the long term I would love to make ChordFork into a full-fledged score editor 
in the browser, but as of right now solving the UI/UX problems associated with 
writing scores in the browser and engraving sheet music in real time are both 
outside of my expertise and too time-consuming to tackle.
